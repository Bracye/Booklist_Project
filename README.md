# Booklist_Project
HTML
1. Linked a Bootstrap link to the head to get the theme for styling
2. Linked font awesome to get the icons 
3. Made sure the HTML was linked to script.js
4. In the body the classes were created with bootstrap to style the HTML
5. Then form groups were created to layout the title, text, and input for the 3 forms
6. Then created a submit button with the value of Add Book to add the book details when filling out the form then bootstrap classes were formed.
7. Then a table was created with rows and headings to hold the submitted books


JAVASCRIPT
1. Created a book class to define the book with it's objects
2. UI class is used to display books and remove them with the alerts created 
3. The UI has a static method "displayBooks()" to get books from the Store class and calls addBookToList() method to display each book on the UI.
4. The addBookToList() method creates a new row in the book list table and adds the book details to the storage, it also pops up a delete button.
5. deleteBook()  removes a book from the UI and the storage when the delete button is clicked
6. showAlert() creates a message based on it being clicked
7. The script.js is written to allow books to be entered and stored into local storage, it also allows books to be removed and taken from local storage. Alert messages are created pertaining to watch event lisenter was used (submit), (clicked) to allow books to be added or removed
8. This code along goes through everything I have been learning and would love to learn more about parse, setTimeout, and other methods used throughout this example.
